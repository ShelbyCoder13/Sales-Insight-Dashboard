# Sales-Insight-Dashboard
Interactive Sales Insight Dashboard created using Power BI

Run the SQL dump file and import your data!! 

Imported data to SQL Server.
Run many SQL commands and understood the realation between the tables and columns.

Imported the data to Power BI and did data cleaning and analysis on Power Query. Created new columns like "Porfit". 
Date Modelling was also a crucial step as it allows us to create realtion between various tables so thet in the visualization phase we do not face issues. 

At last started building the dashboard. It contains :

"Total Revenue" 
"Sales Quantity'
"Top 5 products"
"Revenue Trend"
"Quantity of Products sold by region"
"Revenue by Market


You can always show more with the data. 

#This is a very basic Dashboard build for Beginners.
